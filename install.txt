Sorry that these instructions kinda suck. I created them for my internal use.
Looking at the project a year later, I would have done things differently.

For instance, I now favor using src builds, rather than deb packages.
I'd also prefer /opt/Lonava, versus /usr/local.. Just saying.


Lonava requires:
	python2.6-dev
	tornado
	psycopg2
	python-setuptools

apt-get install postgresql
easy_install ElementTree
easy_install Markdown
apt-get install python-httplib2
sudo apt-get install python-imaging

Properly supporting UTF-8 is an ungly hack, and I'm embarrsed about it.
Again, I'd do differently now (And have!)
You can skip this step if you don't want to run for prod
    locate site.py
    ->
        import sys
        sys.setdefaultencoding('UTF-8')

Now, add the schema-
	psql
	create database lonava;
	create user YOURUSER with password 'YOURPASS';
	grant all privileges on database lonava to YOURUSER;
	Also note- Your user name will end up in lowercase, since you're not quoting it.

	cat schema.sql |  PGPASSWORD="YOURPASS" psql -U youruser -d lonava

	You'll also need to insert the guest user

	lonava=# insert into usrs(usrid,name) values (0,'Guest');

	After you create yourself an acct, make it registered.
	lonava=# update usrs set status = 1 where email = 'you@email.org';
	Log out and back in after doing this.	

At this point, you should be able to run it with ./lonava.py --port=8080

If you want to use nginx to serve it (in prod, you should, you'll need to install it from source)
    apt-get install build-essential libpcre++-dev libssl-dev
    http://www.grid.net.ru/nginx/download/nginx_upload_module-2.0.12.tar.gz
    ./configure --add-module=/root/Utils/nginx-source/nginx-0.8.46/nginx_upload_module-2.0.12/ --with-http_ssl_module 
        make
        make install

    for i in `seq 0 9`; do mkdir  -p /usr/local/lonava/uploads/$i; chmod 660 /usr/local/lonava/uploads/$i; done

    http://www.feedparser.org/
    apt-get install python-beautifulsoup
    http://intertwingly.net/stories/2004/08/04/urlnorm.py

    mkdir /var/log/lonava
    chmod a+w /var/log/lonava

    Add Hacker News fetcher to cron
    Add Sitemap maker to cron
