Lonava is an online Social News site, like Reddit or Digg.
I've added the code here- I know that it's not very well written, but I figured someone might be able to use it.

Start Lonava.py on port 80 for testing, and mess around. 
For production, use the provided init script to run it on 81 82 83 84 and have nginx proxy.

You'll want to create the SQL database as noted in the code.

Postgres schema is stored in schema.sql
nginx files in the nginx directory

The Lonava logo and mascot are not offered under license. I want to keep them. ;)
