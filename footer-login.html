    <h3>How Lonava Works</h3>
    Lonava is a social news site, where users post under their real, legal name.<br><br>
    Requiring posts to be signed with people's real name helps create a tighter sense of real community, and hopefully avoids a lot of trolling.<br><br>
    For more detail about the site, and how it works, take a look at out <a href="/stories/10">our about page</a>.
